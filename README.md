# editorchoosr
A way to select between many editors for programs that allow an external editor
Specifically, this was made for Ableton Live, where you can select an editor for audio files, but I wanted more than one.
Made in rust, because the first version (autohotkey) didn't work, as the parent process exited, remove file access.
Currently windows-only
